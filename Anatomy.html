<h1 style="color: darkred;"  > What is Human Anatomy  </h1>

<p style="font-size: larger;">Human anatomy is the scientific study of the body's structures, from large organs to microscopic cells, focusing on 
    their form, location, and relationships to understand how they work together as a whole. It's divided into gross anatomy
     (visible structures like organs) and microscopic anatomy (tissues and cells), using methods like observation, dissection,
      and imaging to map the body's complex organization</p>

<h1 style="color:  rgb(83, 25, 25);">Human Anatomy</h1>
<p>Human anatomy is primarily the scientific study of the 
    morphology of the human body. Anatomy is subdivided into gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy 
    (also called macroscopic anatomy, topographical anatomy, regional anatomy, or anthropotomy) is the study of anatomical
     structures that can be seen by the naked eye. Microscopic anatomy is the study of minute anatomical structures 
     assisted with microscopes, which includes histology (the study of the organization of tissues), and cytology 
     (the study of cells). Anatomy, human physiology (the study of function), and biochemistry (the study of the chemistry
      of living structures) are complementary basic medical sciences that are generally together (or in tandem) to students studying medical sciences. </p>

      In some of its facets human anatomy is closely related to embryology, comparative anatomy and comparative embryology,
       through common roots in evolution; for example, much of the human body maintains the ancient segmental pattern that is
        present in all vertebrates with basic units being repeated, which is particularly obvious in the vertebral column and 
        in the ribcage, and can be traced from very early embryos.

<h1>Surface Anatomy</h1>
<p>Surface anatomy, or superficial anatomy, is the study of anatomical landmarks that can be identified readily from the contours
     or other reference points on the surface of the body. It is important in human anatomy: with knowledge of superficial anatomy,
      physicians gauge the position and anatomy of deeper structures. </p>
